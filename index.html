           Education in India
     </p>
  
     <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
            As we embark upon a new decade, India celebrates the 10th anniversary of its Right to Education Act (RTE), 
            which went into effect in April 2010. While the RTE has been censured for its limited focus on governance and learning outcomes,
            chievement in improving access to schooling is undeniable. 
            It has also served as a rallying point for a wide range of stakeholders to intervene in the sector.
            But as is well-established by now, India’s learning outcomes remain stubbornly low. 
            Quality concerns around education are seldom viewed as a political priority. 
            But these concerns cannot be ignored for much longer, especially in light of India’s human capital crisis, 
            reflected in unemployment statistics.

         Transforming Education

     <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
            The current face of Education in the nation is actually turning out to be a major “silent hindrance” for India’s track to greater development. 
            While all the attention is on social-political issues, it should quickly be turned on to educational reforms. 
            Eduaction has the power to all solve issues(wars, unemployment, waste management, corruption etc), in the long run, 
            and a must for a developing country like India it cannot be ignored, not to say it is being ignored, India spends a lot of Education( somewhat only 2nd after defence), the results aren’t actually visible….
            We need to completely revamp the system of education. Focus on work experience and adapting to a 21st-century skill set should be on the key agenda list…
            For this, the first step is reducing the burden on kids by deleting stuff from the syllabus, 
            which almost 90% is irrelevant and students actually forget sooner or later and should be replaced with a practical and solution-centric approach to studies which will develop thinkers and leaders of tomorrow.
            I think the govt. is trying hard on this but it still needs to be passed quickly by the houses or else it might turn out to be too late.

        Women's Education
     </p>
  
     <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
        Women have a much lower literacy rate than men. Far fewer girls are enrolled in the schools, and many of them drop out.In the patriarchal setting of the Indian family, girls have lower status and fewer privileges than boys.
        Conservative cultural attitudes prevent some girls from attending school.Furthermore, educated high class women are less likely than uneducated low class women to enter the workforce They opt to stay at home due to the traditional, cultural and religious norms.
        The number of literate women among the female population of India was between 2–6% from the British Raj onward to the formation of the Republic of India in 1947.
        Concerted efforts led to improvement from 15.3% in 1961 to 28.5% in 1981. By 2001 literacy for women had exceeded 50% of the overall female population, 
        though these statistics were still very low compared to world standards and even male literacy within India.[166] Recently the Indian government has launched Saakshar Bharat Mission for Female Literacy. 
        This mission aims to bring down female illiteracy by half of its present level.
